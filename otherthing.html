            <pre>
                [Narrator]
                In 1936, the Olympic Games were held in Berlin, Germany, under the Nazi regime led by Adolf Hitler.
                The Olympic Stadium, known as the Reichssportfeld, was built specifically for the 1936 Summer Olympics. It was a massive complex that included not only the main stadium but also several other facilities for various sports.        
                The stadium's design was overseen by the architect Werner March, who followed the principles of Nazi architecture, with its imposing and monumental structures meant to convey a sense of power and strength.        
                On August 1, 1936, the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games took place at the Olympic Stadium. Hitler himself attended the ceremony and delivered a speech, using the event as a propaganda tool to showcase the supposed superiority of the Aryan race and the Nazi ideology.
                
                Despite the political overtones, the 1936 Berlin Olympics saw numerous athletic achievements and records set by athletes from around the world, including the famous African-American athlete Jesse Owens, who won four gold medals, challenging the Nazi regime's racial ideology.        
                The Olympic Stadium remained an iconic venue in Berlin, even after the fall of the Nazi regime. It underwent renovations and continues to host major sporting events to this day, standing as a reminder of a complex and controversial chapter in history.

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
            During Nazi Germany, the Olympic Stadium in Berlin was utilized as a propaganda tool, symbolizing the regime's power and
            ideology. Constructed for the 1936 Summer Olympics, it showcased Hitler's vision of Aryan superiority to the world.
            Despite its grandeur, the stadium's history is tainted by its association with Nazi propaganda and racial policies.
            However, it also witnessed moments of defiance, such as Jesse Owens' victories, which challenged Hitler's beliefs.
            Today, it serves as a somber reminder of the intertwining of sports and politics during that tumultuous era.
